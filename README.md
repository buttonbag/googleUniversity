## about

This is a living documentation of my own curriculum based on a syllabus I found online of one of the many popular coding bootcamps available for thousands of dollars. I am challenging myself to seek out the information outlined in the popular coding bootcamp in order to learn on my own without the tuition costs and also cut my own time commitment by being able to skip areas that I'm already familliar with. I intend to complete all of the finished projects expected after each section and by the end, I should have a good grasp of the topics covered.

I may also decide to find other lesson plan outlines and follow those if I find that the time I saved by going on my own will give myself the benefit of having completed lesson plans from different schools.

## how

By reading the curriculum and researching the topics covered in each on Google, I am able to read about and follow tutorials on those specific topics.

Most coding bootcamps have a set class schedule and are taught by a live instructor. I will be following my own part-time remote student schedule
